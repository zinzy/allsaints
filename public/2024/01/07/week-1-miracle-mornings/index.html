<li>A somewhat quiet week, mostly spent at the office because Anja&rsquo;s on winter break, although I did enjoy spending time at Coffee Company Oosterdok as well. Working without my regular laptop stand and wireless keyboard and trackpad doesn&rsquo;t feel great for my body, but they make great coffee.</li>

<li>Lemonade did really well on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, and while I think she would&rsquo;ve been fine sleeping in her crate in the loving room, we let her sleep on the bed. We&rsquo;re now people whose dog sleeps on their bed. Another benefit to this, besides cuddles, is that it gives me the living room to wake up calmly.</li>
<li>I spent my winter break walking serious distances in the city, and now that I&rsquo;m back to work the rush of my calendar (even when it was mostly empty this week) made it so that I didn&rsquo;t really go on a single urban hike.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been making a bigger effort to practice the

<li>I&rsquo;ve set a reading challenge on Goodreads this year, and this week I&rsquo;m already down 1, 25 more to go. I&rsquo;ve discovered that non-fiction audio books work well for me.</li>
<li>On Friday, we had farewell drinks for AN. I&rsquo;m quite sad to see him go. He and I both have golden retriever energy, and it was always a bit of a homecoming to be at the office with him.</li>
<li>On Saturday, I went to Coppenhagen for new beads. I&rsquo;ve been looking for excuses to make more rosaries, and I decided I&rsquo;ll make one for each liturgical color.</li>
