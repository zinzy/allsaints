<p>I saw a guy on Monday that I went on a date with once. It was one of those whimsical dates. We had fish by the sea. It felt like coming home a little bit. I think the world was trying to introduce me to something for which I wasn&rsquo;t ready yet. Looking back, that date, more than the others, prepared me for Anja. Looking back through butterfly effect glasses, it might as well have been him.</p>
<p>Yesterday wasn&rsquo;t a great day. They say recovery is a habit and it is. I was feeling quite low about myself. One hour at my friend&rsquo;s citizenship party and I&rsquo;d call it a night. Tomorrow would be full of things, too. Then he arrived. Like an old friend entering the scene.</p>
<p>As soon as I head over, we hug, and he begins telling me that he talks about me when he&rsquo;s teaching storytelling, on an almost weekly basis, eight years on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s when I begin to talk about tension-building&rdquo; he says, and I laugh loudly, after which he eyebrows &ldquo;you know what moment I&rsquo;m talking about, right?&rdquo; I say yes but I don&rsquo;t. Back then, I was too drunk to really remember anything with accuracy.</p>
<p>He turns towards to his friends and continues. &ldquo;I lean in to kiss her, but she rejects me. And I&rsquo;m so nervous, thinking &lsquo;gosh, did I really misread all the signs?!&rsquo;&rdquo; Apparently, then I said these words, which&hellip;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait. This is the last moment that you and I have never kissed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he was telling this story, my entire body lit up. Partially turned on, but predominantly struck with delight. Who is that person? Can I have her number? Oh hold on, he&rsquo;s talking about me.</p>
<p>Two things can be true at once, and for a moment, my experience of myself felt finely in balance. The universe can hold me as the asshole I see in myself, but also as the person whose butterfly wings can make a small change.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the evening meeting kind strangers. White cis gay men who wanted to join the queer meetup I run, where my friend and I met. Kinfolk, effortlessly introduced as we blew 






  
  
  


  <a href="Cat%20whisper.md" class="">Cat whisper</a>s at each other.</p>
<p>My friend looked stunning. An impeccable sense of style, a smile larger than the world, a citizenship bigger than we&rsquo;d ever ask of him. I knew he was suspended mid-air in all sorts of areas of his life, but, looking at him, I suspected he had arrived somewhere long before any of us ever would.</p>
<p>Today, grabbing coffee in the neighborhood, I meet an acquaintance who&rsquo;s on sabbatical until the end of the year, spending his time taking action lessons, storytelling workshops.  I ask him if he has ever heard of the girl who almost rejected a kiss by the sea and he bursts out laughing.</p>
