The venue is not one I can recommend. When requesting a bigger table because more people would be coming, the waiter scoffed at us. Then he closed the red velvet roped entrance. Later, his colleague told me people often just barge into the venue, ignoring waiters&rsquo; requests.">

  <a href="2023-08-22.md" class="">Tuesday</a>, a get-together that started as &ldquo;chilling in the park&rdquo;, and which turned into grabbing a drink at l&rsquo;Osteria. The venue is not one I can recommend. When requesting a bigger table because more people would be coming, the waiter scoffed at us. Then he closed the red velvet roped entrance.

Knowing how anti-queer the church has always been, I never felt comfortable attending a service in Amsterdam. The early 10s fashion made me feel nostalgic, though.</li>
<li>Had a lovely workshop at work about effective team work. It was inspiring, educational, and great for a sense of collaboration, not just with my peers, but also with the company&rsquo;s leadership. It&rsquo;s wonderful to be a part of a company that walks its talk so enthusiastically.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m struggling to be a good dog mom to Lemonade, seeing Anja&rsquo;s conduct and training as much more effective and kind. I&rsquo;ve been working to praise her good behavior more than I punish her mistakes.</li>
