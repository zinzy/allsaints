<p>Happiness today is the ease with which the nun gives me his phone number. Paul is an old friend, or really an old friend of my ex, and we haven&rsquo;t spoken in eight years.</p>
<p>I had emailed him late last year, missing our kitchen table conversations over coffee and cigarettes. His enormous house, a former school, functioning as his private art studio / gallery. He had replied right away, saying &ldquo;my phone number is still the same&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I had lost it long ago, of course.</p>
<p>Today, as I walk home from a coffee run, I think of him, and decide that I should make one last attempt to find his phone number before emailing him again. Looking over his message, I notice he said he no longer lived in the old school, and something about nuns. I suppose I had overlooked it the first time I read it, imagining he lived <em>near</em> a convent rather than in an actual carmelite care facility.</p>
<p>A friendly nun is happy to give me his number right away. A glimpse into a world of old, filled with kind people making generous assumptions. Two minutes later I hear his voice. &ldquo;hello?&rdquo;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all surprised you ended up living with a bunch of nuns, Paul&rdquo; I glee into the phone, remembering our conversations about the Church, his Protestant, mine Catholic. There had always been something about Catholic liturgy that inspired him.</p>
<p>Despite his heavy bout of Covid, double pneumonia, and delirium, he still remembers me. Within minutes, we slide back into a conversation that never really began and never really ended.</p>
<p>Both of us are still the same to one another.</p>
<p>He gives me splinters of stories: a thieving cleaning lady, the storage and eventual donation of his body of work, the conversations he has with his neighbor priest. I tell him about Anja, about our small apartment, and about my eternal journey finding a Christian place I can call home.</p>
<p>We agree that I&rsquo;ll come visit soon, and I will. A few misremembered numbers and names aside, he&rsquo;s still the same old Paul. But by God, he nearly wasn&rsquo;t here, and I don&rsquo;t have time to waste.</p>
