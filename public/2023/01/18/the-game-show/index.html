<a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/786/its-a-game-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=" after:content-[' ↗'] ">an episode of one of my favorite podcasts, <em>This American Life</em></a>, Jiayang participated in a game show designed around a talent she claims to possess: the unique ability, inspired by her anxiety, to tell at what age a Chinese-American person came to the United States. The show gave her recordings of three people to prove herself. (She got 0 out of 3.)</p>
<p>Nothing human is alien to me, and neither is Jiayang&rsquo;s desire to blend in phonetically.</p>
<p>Growing up in the Dutch South, I wasn&rsquo;t ever unaware of my accent, but it took me enrolling in Utrecht University to become fully aware of the effect it had on others. I could barely make it through class participation without someone chuckling in the back row of lecture hall. I decided that, on the very day I found housing in Utrecht, I would change my accent. These days, few people can tell I&rsquo;m from the South. I like it that way.</p>
<p>Another thing I&rsquo;ve always been afraid to sound was &ldquo;black&rdquo;. In the Netherlands, that usually means sounding like you were born and (partially) raised in an African country, Suriname, or the Antilles. With no such history, I&rsquo;m silly to think I could ever fall into that category, which is a fine category in itself. Still, every now and then people will tell me I sound Surinamese. Unable to shake my internalized racism, I always find myself offended when they do.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode reminded me of the duality of being a person of color in a conversation about speech. Like Jiayang, I find myself comparing my speech to that of other Black people, forming opinions on what I think is or isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;good&rdquo;. At the same time, I would find it problematic if other, non-Black people were doing it for me. To me, there&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong in that distinction; it&rsquo;s important people can tell their own story and not have it told for them. I&rsquo;m just struck by the number of times I asked &ldquo;babe, is this the example we want to give?&rdquo;</p>
